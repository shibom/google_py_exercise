18.37+50.75 = 69.12 each person
i spent 73.49, and tufan da spent 203

so, I will recieve 73.49 - 69.12 = 4.37

tufan da will recieve 203 - 69.12 = 133.88

tufan da will recieve 133.88/3 = 44.63 from each of us.

I will recieve 4.37/3 = 1.45 from each of you.

total expenses = 203 + 73.49 = 276.49

so each of us will spend = 69.12
